# user_lookup 

This project is a simple web-based user search tool that filters users based on their gender and hobbies, and dynamically displays user information, including their avatar, name, and hobby. The project uses vanilla JavaScript for the search functionality and basic HTML and CSS for the layout.
Features:

    User Filtering: Users can be filtered based on gender (Male, Female, or All) and hobbies.
    Dynamic Content Rendering: Based on the search criteria, the user information (including an avatar) is dynamically rendered in the results section.
    Add as Friend Button: Each user row comes with an "Add as friend" button for potential future interactions (currently not functional).

How It Works:

    The user inputs a hobby and selects a gender from a dropdown.
    On clicking the "Search" button, the script filters a predefined list of users based on the input criteria.
    The filtered results are displayed below the search form, showing the user's name, hobby, and avatar image.
    The avatars are dynamically loaded from the images directory, and their filenames are referenced in the user data.
